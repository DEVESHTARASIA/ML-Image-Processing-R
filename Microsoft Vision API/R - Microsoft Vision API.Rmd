# Microsoft Cognitive Services Vision API in R  

----

A little while ago I did a brief tutorial of the [Google Vision API using RoogleVision](https://www.stoltzmaniac.com/google-vision-api-in-r-rooglevision/) created by Mark Edmonson. I couldn't find anything similar to that in R for the [Microsoft Cognitive Services API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts/python#AnalyzeImage) so I thought I would give it a shot. I whipped this example together quickly to give it a proof-of-concept but I could certainly see myself building an R package to support this (unless someone can point to one - and please do if one exists)!  


The API is extremely easy to access using RCurl and httr. There are **a lot** of options which can be accessed. In this example, I'll just cover the basics of image detection and descriptions.  


### Getting Started With Microsoft Cognitive Services

In order to get started, all you need is an [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) which is **free** if you can keep yourself under certain thresholds and limits. There is even a free trial period (at the time this was written, at least).  

Once that is taken care of there are a few things you need to do:  

  1. Login to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
  2. On the lefthand menu click "Add"

  3. Click on "AI + Cognitive Services" and then the "Computer Vision API"
  ![Figure 2](https://i.imgur.com/GMy2LFZ.png)  
  
  
  4. Fill out the information required. You may have "Free Trial" under Subscription. Pay special attention to **Location** because this will be used in your API script

  5. In the lefthand menu, click "Keys" underneath "Resource Management" and you will find what you need for credentials. Underneath your Endpoint URL, click on "Show access keys..." - **copy your key** and use it in your script (do not make this publicly accessible)
